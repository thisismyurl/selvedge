/**
 * [CORE] Bootstrap — the single re-prefixing point for the whole theme line.
 *
 * This is the ONE place a theme's identity lives. Change the namespace and the
 * SLUG constant and the entire theme re-prefixes, because every other file
 * derives its asset handles, hooks, and i18n keys from this namespace and these
 * constants. With Colophon, the `colophon` CLI rewrites the namespace, slug, and
 * version here from the theme's colophon.json on every sync. The constants are
 * the source of truth at runtime; the CLI just keeps them honest.
 *
 * Why a namespace instead of a `selvedge_`-style function prefix:
 * callbacks register as `__NAMESPACE__ . '\\fn'`, so renaming the namespace
 * re-points every hook at once, with no second list of callback strings to sync.
 * WordPress.org requires a unique prefix per theme; this concentrates that whole
 * requirement into the one line below.
 *
 * NOTE — the one place "tidy" is a bug: the text DOMAIN in __()/_e()/esc_html__()
 * stays a string LITERAL ('selvedge'), never the SLUG constant. `wp i18n make-pot`
 * reads source statically and only recognises a literal as the domain argument;
 * hand it a constant and it extracts nothing and ships an untranslatable theme.
 *
 * Pillar 9 (Archaeological Records): this header is the authoritative record of
 * who this theme is. Change it here and only here.
